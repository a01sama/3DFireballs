3DFireBalls is an incredibly addicting game that gives you the chance to prove how far your skills, aim, precision, focus and agility capacity can go inside super fun and challenging rounds. If you're looking for a challenge that gets you hooked for hours, sharpen your aim and thrust yourself into this 3D adventure.

Gameplay in this game is really simple, but completing the levels will be an uphill battle for you. In order to successfully complete each stage, you'll have to knock down the tower standing in front of you. That tower is made up of a ton of levels that you'll have to break by shooting at them. Press spacebar to shoot a bullet. Every time the bullet crashes against the tower, it'll sink down a level. 

The difficulty in 3DFireBalls is that between the tower and your ship you'll find a number of blockers that rotate around it. So, it's really difficult to make the bullets impact the tower.

Another added feature is the Navigation mode. You can leave the game and navigate around all the 4 different setups. Setups include different models and you can use arrow keys to enjoy the environment.
